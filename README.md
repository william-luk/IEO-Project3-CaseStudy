# Your Experience is My Experience 
## Visualizing an Installation for Group Interaction

In this project, students are asked to develop their Project 2 prototypes into a conceptualized application of their sensors and physical computing systems. As they proceeded in each process of Project 1 and 2, the next step is to visualize how their prototypes may be used, how they should function and what new ideas can be created in their design research.

Students will have the opportunity to continue their prototype exploration and/or apply design research to add validity, robustness and feasibility of their prototype's design, technology, idea and concepts. Students will gain more advanced skills in their design process to sell prototypes in the industry or pitch.

This case study will explore the application, technicality and conceptualization in practice of a two-way communication button developed by Michael Brzuchalski and William Luk. Due to COVID-19 safety measures, in person development of physical group ideation and prototyping did not happen. Efforts to communicate ideation strategies and activities in text will be used.

### Where does this apply?
#### FINDING THE APPLICATION OF THE PHYSICAL PROTOTYPE

In the previous project, Michael and William developed a two way communication device using Adafruit IO, ESP8266 Feather HUZZAH and p5js to trigger a simple change on the button press to a p5 sketch, [shown here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvUjG0uZmqE). The technical features of the controller were thoroughly established as the team believed it to be beneficial to start design research and "theory-crafting" potential solutions and applications of their controller.

Working through the Design Matrix, the team produced several project ideas of how their system can be used. A design matrix is a guideline for generation design concepts and discovering meaningful areas of exploration for physical computing projects. Using a design matrix provided to students, 3 categories named "Design Taxonomy", "Area of Focus" and "Sensory Environment" with relevant sub-categories helped to direct the potential nature and use of prototype controller. Using the matrix, the team established:

```markdown
**Design Taxonomy**
* Crowd Participation
  - Increased number of users enhance or instigate increased physical/ emotional/ media/computational response
  
**Area of Focus**
* Media Architecture
  - Computational display systems incorporated into the physical landscape including screens, lights, and projections.
  
**Sensory Environment**
* Visual: Graphic
  - 2D physical imaging technologies that use pigment or found objects, including printing, painting, and mixed media.
  
* Visual: Distorion
  - Intentionally or randomly affecting the pattern of a series or sequence of light/pixels/images.
  
* Sound: Distortion/Generation
  - Intentionally or randomly affecting the pattern of, or creating of, an audio wave or series.
  
* Sound: Sonification
  - Using non-speech audio to perceptualize data.
```
